# Team Profile Generator

This is a team profile page generator for developer or similar industry teams consisting of a manager, engineers, and/or interns. It utilizes [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for a series of prompts that allow input of employee info.

Once the user is finished adding to the team, an `index.html` file is created, displaying each employee's info on a card.
